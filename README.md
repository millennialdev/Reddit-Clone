# Reddit Clone Using MERN Stack

## Thanks for the gold kind stranger! üòâ

## This was done in part as a coding exercise for CoSchedule, and is a Clone of the famous website that often goes by the name of Reddit, and also this app utilizes the HackerNews API.

## Requirements

#### You will need `node`, `yarn`, `mongoDB (locally)`, and `create-react-app (CRA)` in order to install and then setup this project.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

#### Make sure to read through the requirements section of this `README.md` file and make sure that you have everything required. After you have a copy of the repository on your computer, you will need to navigate in your terminal over to the root folder for this project.

#### From there you will need to change into both the `/api` and `/client` folders (ideally in 2x seperate terminals, because you will need 2x right after this step). Once you are in both of those directories, you will want to run the following command on both of them: `yarn install` or just `yarn` (either will do, they do the same thing).

#### After all of your dependancies are installed for both client and server, you will now want to the the following commands in both respective directories:

#### for `/api` run `yarn run serve`

#### for `/client` run `yarn run start`

#### After you have checked that both of these terminals were able to successfully run these commands, go to your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000`, and that is where you should see the Reddit Clone running üòÅ.

### Installation:

Make sure you have MongoDB running locally, otherwise you may not get much (if any at all) of the functionality that is built into this app.
